.SH NAME
hsh \- A custom UNIX command line interpreter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[
.I file
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B hsh
program is a simple implementation of a UNIX command line interpreter
written in C language for Holberton School France curriculum.

It reads commands from standard input (interactive mode) or from a file
or pipe (non-interactive mode), and executes them.

For each command line, the shell:

.IP 1. 4
Displays a prompt when running interactively.
.IP 2.
Parses the command line into tokens.
.IP 3.
Executes built-in commands when applicable.
.IP 4.
Otherwise searches for the command in the directories listed in
the PATH environment variable and executes it using
.BR execve (2).

If a command cannot be executed,
.B hsh
prints an error message and continues reading input.

End of file (Ctrl\-D) terminates the shell.

.SH BUILTINS
.TP
.B exit [status]
Exit the shell.

If
.I status
is provided, it is used as the shell exit status.
If no status is provided, the shell exits with status 0.

.TP
.B env
Print the current environment, one variable per line.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of
.B hsh
is normally the exit status of the last executed command.

If the
.B exit
built-in is used, the shell terminates with the given status.
